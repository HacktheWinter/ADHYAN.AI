# ADHYAN.AI

> **ADHYAN.AI is an AI-powered smart classroom platform that automates assessment creation, subjective grading, and academic integrity checks — helping educators save time and conduct fair, trustworthy digital assessments.**

---

## Problem / Challenge :

Modern digital classrooms face three major challenges:

1. **Teacher Overload & Burnout**  
   Teachers spend a huge amount of time manually creating quizzes, checking assignments, and grading subjective answers — reducing time available for actual teaching and mentoring.

2. **Lack of Scalable Subjective Grading**  
   Most online platforms handle only objective questions well. Subjective answers (short/long answers, explanations) still require heavy manual evaluation.

3. **Academic Integrity in Online Assessments**  
   With easy access to AI tools and the internet, ensuring fair exams and preventing misuse has become increasingly difficult, especially in remote and hybrid learning environments.

Existing Learning Management Systems focus on content delivery, **not on intelligent assessment and integrity**, leaving a large gap in digital education.

---

## Our Solution

**ADHYAN.AI** addresses these challenges by providing a unified AI-powered assessment platform that:

- Automatically converts lecture notes into quizzes and test papers
- Uses **source-grounded AI** to evaluate subjective answers fairly
- Monitors assessment sessions to discourage unfair practices
- Gives teachers actionable analytics instead of raw data

The goal is not to replace teachers, but to **augment them** — reducing repetitive workload while improving the quality and credibility of digital assessments.
