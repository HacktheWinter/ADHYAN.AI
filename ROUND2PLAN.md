# Round 2: What's Coming Next for ADHYAN.AI

We aren't stopping here. The next phase of ADHYAN.AI is all about making the classroom experience even more interactive and secure. Here is what we are building next:

## 1. Live Classes & Video Lectures
We are bringing the classroom online for real. Teachers will have a dedicated video section where they can:
- **Go Live:** Host real-time interactive classes directly on the platform.
- **Upload Lectures:** Post recorded video sessions for students to watch later, making revision easier.

## 2. Smart Calendar & Announcements
No more "I didn't know the deadline" excuses.
- **Centralized Schedule:** Teachers can mark everything on a built-in calendar—quizzes, test papers, assignments, and live class timings.
- **Auto-Sync:** Anything added to the calendar immediately pops up on the Student Dashboard and sends an automatic email reminder. Everyone stays on the same page without extra effort.

## 3. Serious Anti-Cheat System (Proctoring)
We are tightening security to ensure fair assessments.
- **Full-Screen Lockdown:** When a student starts a quiz or test, the browser goes into full-screen mode.
- **Strict Warning System:** If a student tries to switch tabs or exit full screen:
    1.  **First attempt:** They get a strict warning popup.
    2.  **Second attempt:** The test automatically submits exactly as it is. Game over.

## 4. Better Doubt Resolution
We know the Doubt Section has had some hiccups. We are fixing those specific errors to make asking and answering questions smooth and reliable.

## 5. UI Overhaul
We are refreshing the entire look and feel. The new UI will be cleaner, easier to navigate, and more "human-centric" for both teachers and students.
